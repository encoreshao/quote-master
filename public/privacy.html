  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong> Last Updated: 2024-07-05 </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Quote Master</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
    explains our principles regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use our Chrome
    extension and related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Quote Master</strong> respects your privacy and is designed with this principle in mind. We do not collect,
    store, or share any personal information from our users. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other
      personally identifiable information.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We do not track or store information about your use of the Service, including your
      interactions with bookmarks, extensions, or tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: We do not collect information about your device, such as IP address, browser
      type, or operating system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Since we do not collect any personal or usage information, we do not use your information in any way. All features of
    <strong>Quote Master</strong> operate locally on your device, and any data related to bookmarks, extensions,
    downloads, and tasks is stored locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>3. Security</h2>
  <p>Although we do not collect any data, we prioritize the security of the information stored locally on your device.
    <strong>Quote Master</strong> employs industry-standard security measures to protect your data.</p>

  <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Service is not intended for children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any information, we also do not
    knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational,
    legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this
    policy.</p>
